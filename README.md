# MAMUT-routing-lib

Modern Python library for CVRP and VRPTW benchmark models, validation, BKS management, and snapshot retrieval.

## MAMUT project context

This repository is part of the [MAMUT project](https://github.com/ANR-MAMUT) ([ANR-22-CE22-0016](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-22-CE22-0016)), an academic research project aiming to advance the state of the art in combinatorial optimization for logistics and transportation problems. 

## Scope

`mamut_routing_lib` is a standalone Python contract/runtime layer to work with the routing benchmarks curated in the [MAMUT-routing](https://github.com/ANR-MAMUT/MAMUT-routing) repository. It is inspired by projects like [VRPLIB](https://github.com/PyVRP/VRPLIB) and is intended as a general-purpose library for working with CVRP and VRPTW benchmark instances, both historical and newly generated as well as their associated BKS and metadata.

It provides:

- historical VRPTW benchmark models
- generated CVRP and VRPTW benchmark models
- local benchmark discovery and JSON I/O
- solution checking
- BKS creation and replacement logic
- optional remote snapshot archive retrieval

This repository does not own site generation, publication-history generation, migration pipelines, or solver integrations. It is a pure contract and runtime library for benchmark data management intended to be used by researchers and practitioners alike, both inside and outside the MAMUT project.

## Installation

```bash
pip install mamut-routing-lib
```

or, using the modern [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) Python package manager:

```bash
uv add mamut-routing-lib
```

## Local Loading

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mamut_routing_lib import discover_benchmark_instances

items = discover_benchmark_instances(
    benchmarks_root=Path("/path/to/benchmarks"),
)
```

## Remote Snapshot Retrieval

The optional remote module consumes release manifests and release assets published by a benchmark repository such as `MAMUT-routing`.

Default environment variables:

- `MAMUT_ROUTING_RELEASE_REPO`
- `MAMUT_ROUTING_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `MAMUT_ROUTING_ROOT`
- `MAMUT_ROUTING_BENCHMARKS_ROOT`
